Dear Mr. Da Silva,
\vspace{15pt}

I am writing to express my keen interest in the Backend Engineer position at Sano Genetics. With a deep-rooted passion for genetics, bioinformatics, and genomics, combined with my strong background in backend development and commitment to interdisciplinary approaches, I am eager to contribute to your innovative team.

In my recent role as a Backend Engineer at a fintech company, I spearheaded the development of a secure gRPC backend from inception, ensuring seamless encryption of sensitive data. This greenfield project involved collaborating closely with cross-functional teams to design and optimise database schemas for efficiency and scalability.

With professional experience as a backend engineer, a PgCert in Computer Science and AI, and a BSc in Biochemistry, I bring a unique blend of technical expertise and domain knowledge to the table. Having followed Sano Genetics for some time for its groundbreaking work in leveraging genetic data to advance scientific research, the opportunity to work at the crossroads of genetics, bioinformatics, and technology is incredibly exciting to me, and I am enthusiastic about the prospect of contributing to projects that solve real-life problems and make a meaningful impact on healthcare and scientific discovery.
